# Python-project
This is a emotion recognition python based project.
In this project I have used OpenCV a python based library, it can be used to face detection and facial recognition
It reads an image based on its pixel value and analyse the pattern and use those to predict the human emotions
It uses the default webcam of the device for the image and uses the frames to detect the emotions
